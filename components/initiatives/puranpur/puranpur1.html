						Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, IIT Roorkee organized a Cattle Vaccination programme in Puranpur Village of Haridwar District on October 20, 2018. The aim of the programme was the vaccination of cattle against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) which may affect their health severely.
						Animals with FMD typically have fever and blisters on tongue and lips, in and around the mouth, and on mammary glands and around the hooves. FMD apart from being harmful to animals, also cause production loss and hardship for farmers and ranchers.

						This initiative was a successful attempt to promote cattle farming in the village of Puranpur by providing free vaccination for cattle in the village for FMD. The team collaborated with the government veterinary hospital in Bahadarabad for the vaccination drive.
						<br>
						The doctor informed the team that as per a government scheme, the cattle are being vaccinated against FMD at the cost of Rs.2/- per vaccine. However, due to lack of awareness against the scheme, very few of the cattle owners vaccinate their cattle. So the team decided to carry out a vaccination drive against FMD the cost of which will not be taken by the villagers.
