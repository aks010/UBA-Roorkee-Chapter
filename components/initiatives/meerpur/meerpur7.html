						Team UBA found that villagers who have Poly House installed in their farms use their intuition or assumptions to check whether the soil moisture is below certain level or not or whether the temperature inside the poly house is under optimum range for that particular crop or not. These assumptions are not always true thus leading to less productivity. Therefore, team UBA in collaboration with Models and Robotics Section, IIT Roorkee, is developing a device which will automate the entire process of maintaining the soil moisture and temperature inside the poly house to the required level for that particular crop. The device autonomously senses the temperature, soil moisture level using different sensors, like for horticulture ambient temperature is 70-80Â°F and the device ensures that the temperature not rise above this. If the device senses that the temperature is more than the optimum range, the device will automatically turn on the sprinklers inside the polyhouse to bring down the temperature to the optimum range.
