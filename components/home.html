	<p>Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is a Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India program to uplift rural India. It is inspired by the vision of transformational change in rural development processes by leveraging knowledge institutions to help build the architecture of an Inclusive India. Its mission is conceptualized as a movement to enable processes that connect institutes of higher education with local communities to address the developmental challenges of rural India through participatory processes and appropriate technologies for accelerating sustainable growth. It also aims to create a virtuous cycle between society and an inclusive university system by providing knowledge and practices for emerging professions and to upgrade the capabilities of both the public and the private sectors. Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), National Institute of Technology (NITs), and other leading Government Engineering Institutes are driving this program of Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.</p>
	<p>	Under the aegis of UBA, IIT Roorkee has identified 8 villages namely Beladi-Salhapur, Chandpur-Horawala, Chandpur, Chandpur-Kala, Chharba, Meerpur-Muwazarpur and Puranpur. The student team identifies problems persisting in the villages and proposes solutions pertaining to the fields including but not limited to sanitation & cleanliness, education, skill development, agriculture, physical infrastructure, social and institutional infrastructure.

<div style="" class="parallax-text container" data-aos="zoom-in">
	<p>The conceptualization of Unnat Bharat Abhiyan started with the initiative of a group of dedicated faculty members of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi working for long in the area of rural development and appropriate technology. The concept was nurtured through wide consultation with the representatives of a number of technical institutions, Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) coordinators, voluntary organizations and government agencies, actively involved in rural development work, during a National workshop held at IIT Delhi in September, 2014. The workshop was sponsored by Council for Advancement of People’s Action and Rural Technology (CAPART), Ministry of Rural Development, Govt. of India. The program was formally launched by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) in presence of The President of India on 11th Novembter, 2014.</p>
