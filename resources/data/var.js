			"text": "In India, the concept of discussing changes that one undergoes during adolescence is still considered a taboo in many small towns and villages. Children undergoing this phase have many questions that need to be answered. Providing education on physical, moral, behavioral and social changes during puberty is something which seeks our immediate attention. This led to the initiation of AAP that would not only sensitize the adolescents of Chharba but also help in overcoming the stigma that many adolescents face while talking of the changes and developments that they go through. \nThe Adolescence Awareness Programme aims at sensitizing adolescents about the physical and mental changes that one faces during the transition from childhood to adulthood. The programme mainly targets the students of class VI to XII of Village Chharba. The team decided to conduct this camp in two phases. The first session took place on July 29,2017 where 85 girls attended the camp and the second session will take place on August 19, 2017. Similar camp has been replicated in the village Meerpur on August 12, 2017."

With an aim to bring this scheme to the knowledge of the common people of Chharba, Team members Mr. Deepesh Dhakad and Mr. Sankalp Tripathi came up with an initiative, wherein they collaborated with electricity department of Selaqui, Dehradun, to organize awareness cum LED distribution campaign.The camp was organised on August, 2016 and also on April 8, 2017. The campaign saw a huge response from the villagers and was attended by well-known individuals of the village including the Pradhan of the village, Mr. Ramkaran and Ex-Pradhan, Mr. Rumi Ram Jaiswal. They lauded the efforts of the team highlighting the need and importance of energy conservation and promised full cooperation for any initiative taken by our team in the village. 307 LED lights were distributed to 102 families of the village in the first camp and 356 LED lights in the second camp.A total number of 25 man-hours were invested in this camp. A survey done a few weeks after the camp found out that almost every household now used at least one LED light in their home, which was the result of joint efforts of UBA Chharba and electricity department. The initiative was no longer limited to Chharba, Dean of Students Welfare at IIT Roorkee inspired by team UBA, agreed to purchase 1200 LED Tube Lights for all the hostels.

			"text": 'With an exponential rise in population, it is becoming increasingly difficult to provide food for the world. The need of the hour is the sustainable agricultural practices and hence the Organic farming.Organic farming is an alternative technique, which involves cultivation of plants and rearing of animals in natural ways. This process involves the use of biological materials to maintain soil fertility and ecological balance to minimise pollution and wastage. It relies on principles like crop rotation, green manure, organic waste, biological pest control etc.A team of six members led by Mr.Shubham Vishvakarma organized an organic farming camp in collaboration with Uttrakhand Organic Commodity Board (UOCB). The camp was organized in primary school 2 near Chharba village.48 farmers attended the camp with full enthusiasm and took part in Krishi Gosthi coor which lasted for more than three hours. Mr. Sandeep Kumar, field officer, UOCB, in his address to the farmers emphasised that organic farming is the future of agriculture. He discussed issues like buffering of organic farming fields and training of farmers for the same. Questions over quality and quantity of organic farming products, their prices in the market and the cost comparison with traditional farming were raised to the field officer,which he answered in detail. Few of the farmers were much impressed with this new type of farming and decided to adopt the alternative method of farming from the next agri session. To give a boost to the idea of organic farming in the village, Mr. Rumi Ram Jaiswal has started a business dealing with organic seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Team UBA Chharba also identified some issues including the problem of hay storage and lack of proper training in the village. Technical officer, UOCB, Mr.Sanjeev Srivastava appreciated the work done by team and promised to collaborate with us in their future initiatives.'

Agriculture is also one of the areas where technology is enhancing the production.Polyhouse farming is an alternative new technique in agriculture gaining foothold in rural India. It reduces dependency on rainfall & makes the optimum use of land and water resources.The UBA Meerpur team discussed on the feasibility of the polyhouse for other farmers in the village Meerpur but then found that awareness, rather than feasibility, was a bigger challenge.This initiative was led by Mr. Arpit Jindal.An awareness session was organised on April 10, 2016 with about 80 people attending the camp.As a result, 8 people came forward to give their names for installation of polyhouses in their farms.Till now 2 farmers have installed polyhouses where 6 farmer's applications have been accepted."

These workshops were organised in collabration with various government agencies like ARSH, AYUSH, etc."

Aadhar can be used as a permanent Financial Address and facilitates financial inclusion of the underprivileged and weaker sections of the society and is therefore a tool of distributive justice and equality.Aadhar Cards were introduced to provide this unique identity to every living individual in India. However, even after many years of implementation of the scheme, there are 10-12% of Indians who still don't possess Aadhar Card.After surveying for the same, UBA Team is supporting Indian government to bring down the above-mentioned figure close to zero. A one-day Aadhar Card Enrollment Camp was organized in Beladi-Salhapur village. A total of 165 people were enrolled for Aadhar Card and registered candidates will be receiving thier cards soon."
